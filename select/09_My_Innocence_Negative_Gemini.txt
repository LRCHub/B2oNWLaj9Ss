I don't care about my elegance
You can see that when you deserve it
I don't care about my pitch
You're getting off easy, this is nothing
Life is not a pretty package
It's something that just falls apart in your hands
And I just want some justice
But I'm down on my knees swallowing all of this
Give me a break
I've got every right to be incensed
Give me back my innocence
Give me a break
I've got every right to be incensed
Give me back my innocence
