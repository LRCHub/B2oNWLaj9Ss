Cut off the light
Take a look
There's nothing beyond but pain
Suffer in the deepest void
The flame of hope is gone
What have I done?
Denied the father and the son
For a moment it seemed

There's space beyond the spheres
Aflame the night
So clear and bright
Unstable light
You've been sacrificed in fear
Now there's one thing for sure

I'm not afraid anymore
Day after day we've been fixed in this bowl
For so long
For ages we're captured in shells

And crystalized walls
Predestined or punished?
By man or god?

I cannot, I will not
Deny it's false innocence
I cannot, I will not
The age of false innocence
Take it away from me
For a while

Astronomy has moved the earth
And we've turned around the sun
Sanctum officium
Has made me believe
Has made me believe

Has made me believe
"We know for sure you're lying
Would you like to mess with holy science
You know the fear of dying
Would it be worth it

To hear you crying
I've slaughtered truth
And I've shattered my heart
Far too long I have played with hellfire

And science has turned into madness
But I should have taken it higher

So I feel so I feel
Like judas must have felt before
That wednesday night near by the tree
I cannot, I will not
Deny it's false innocence

I cannot, I will not
The age of false innocence
Take it away from me
Day after day we will
Gratefully suffer for more
Predestined's our part
So we bleed
In the name of god
Don't believe in thier eternity
We're still held in blindness
And I've been turned into a liar
If there is no heaven
There won't be release
I cannot, I will not
Deny it's false innocence
I cannot, I will not
The age of false innocence
I cannot, I will not...
Deny it's false innocence
I cannot, I will not
The age of false innocence
Take it away from me
