# NoisyCell – Innocence

```
You held out a small hand,
Smiling, like to you it was so
natural
It may have no meaning but it is
something I can not do
You touched my hand without
thinking but it was nice for me
All the time that we believed
that the world was in our hands
We were wrong, maybe it wasn't
I just wanna hope so when
I'm holding your hand
"Would you hold my hand?"
Could I have ever said that?
I can't remember
(I can't remember)
Why is it unclear? I guess
I'm just not who I used to be
At times I cried and cried, and
at times I smiled.
All the time we could not
believe that the world was in
our hands
We were wrong, in fact it was
'cause you're holding
my hand now.
We've always been part of the
world and the world has never
changed.
How about you? How about me?
We just know that we have
changed.
All the time that we believed
that the world was in our hands
We were wrong, maybe it wasn't
'cause you're holding
my hand now.
We've always been part of the
world and the world has never
changed.
How about you? How about me?
We just know that we have
changed
At every moment, everywhere
I can believe, I can believe
when I'm holding your warm hand
Your warm hand
At times I cried and cried, and
at times I smiled.
